I want to build a pipe calculator where I can calculate the quantity and diameters of pipes in a certain volume.Knowing that in some cases, the pipes can enter inside each other where  the inputs are:
Volume details: a. Dimensions of the available volume. (Length, Width, Height). b. Total weight can carry.
Pipes details: a. External and Internal Diameters of the pipes. b. Lengths of the pipes. c. the wall thickness of the pipes which is the the external diameter minus the internal diameter. d. the weight in Kg/m of each pipe diameter
min space between pipes, if existed.
allowance which is the space between the bigger pipe and the smaller one that will be getting inside it.
In some cases, there are boxes with their dimensions can be added to the pipes in the specified volume.


The outputs are:
the total quantity of each pipe with their length, and weight. The calculator should show the optimal usage of that volume.
A simple sketch showing the arrangement of pipes in the specified volume area.


the prompt:
Build a web page for a "Pipe Calculator" with the following features:

Inputs:
- Volume details:
  - Dimensions of the available volume (Length, Width, Height)
  - Total weight the volume can carry
- Pipes details:
  - External and internal diameters of each pipe
  - Lengths of the pipes
  - Wall thickness (external diameter minus internal diameter)
  - Weight in Kg/m for each pipe diameter
- Minimum space between pipes (if any)
- Allowance (space between a bigger pipe and a smaller one nested inside it)
- Optionally, boxes with their dimensions can be added to the volume along with the pipes

Outputs:
- The total quantity of each pipe, with their length and weight
- The optimal usage of the specified volume
- A simple sketch or diagram showing the arrangement of pipes (and boxes, if any) in the specified volume

The calculator should handle cases where pipes can be nested inside each other and should allow for the inclusion of boxes. The UI should be user-friendly and clearly display both the input fields and the calculated results, including the sketch.
